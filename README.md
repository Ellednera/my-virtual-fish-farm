The source code will be uploaded later. So, for the moment just run the executables and have fun :)

On Linux, do the following using the terminal:

```bash
./my-virtual-fish-farm.out
```

On Windows, either type the following in cmd and hit enter:

```
my-virtual-fish-farm.exe
```

Or double click the executable file to run it.

### About the Modules
Term::ANSIColor and Term::ANSIColor::WithWin32 are not own by me and the source code included here are not modified whatsoever.

These modules are just included for convenience sake so that you can run the source file without the need to install the modules. Very portable indeed :)

You can find the respective module owners and their licenses by searching the module names at (https://metacpan.org)
